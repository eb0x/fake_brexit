# Twitter Data Retrieval -- fake_brexit

This pair of matched applications retrieves tweets using the Twitter API and saved results into a SQLite DB.

Originally designed to retrieve tweets about Brexit it could be expanded for any query. 

Best point is that it checks for any SLA violations (i.e. retrieval limits set by Twitter) so runs for extended periods.
